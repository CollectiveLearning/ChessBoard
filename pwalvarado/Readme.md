## Chess board, second approach

Print to the standard output a chessboard of size N,M where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns.
You have to print a 0 where the board is white and an 1 otherwise.
Index (0,0) is white and it is the top left cell in the produced output.

Sample input:
9,10

Sample output:
```
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
```
In order to execute, you need to type this command in the terminal `ruby chess_board.rb <rows> <columns>`
```bash
$ ruby chess_board.rb 9 10
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1

```
