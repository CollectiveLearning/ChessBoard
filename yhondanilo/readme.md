This is my way to make two nested arrays, which expect 2 params from the user: Firts "filas" and second "Columnas". 
It's have tree methods. Initialize who takes the user params and turn it on two instance variables.
The second is intercalar who make the main move. Creates two nested arrays with Array.new class and send it the two instance variables. Later on the program runs on the nested array fill it in with the if conditions.
The third one just runs on the nested array and print the array values
